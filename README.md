# Power-BI-Project-Comprehensive-Loan-Risk-Demographic-Analysis
A Power BI analysis using Dataflows exploring loan distribution, applicant demographics, and financial risk. It highlights trends in loan amounts, defaults, and behavior by age, credit score, employment type, and marital status—offering key insights for risk assessment and lending strategy.

✅ Overview
This dashboard analyzes:
1)Loan amount trends by purpose, income group, and year
2)Default rates by employment type, year, and credit score
3)Borrower profiles segmented by age group, marital status, and education
4)Year-over-year changes in both loan amounts and default loans

The goal is to help visualize financial and demographic risk metrics in the lending industry.

🔍 Key Features
1)Interactive slicers for age group, employment, marital status, and credit score
2)Dataflow-based preprocessing to ensure scalable and centralized data management
3)Year-over-year (YOY) trend analysis of loan issuance and default rates
4)Comparison of loan behavior across different demographic and financial segments

🧮 Data Sources
1)Mock loan dataset (structured to simulate real-world lending data)
2)Processed and transformed using Power BI Dataflow

Fields include:

1)Loan Amount, Credit Score, Employment Type
2)Age Group, Marital Status, Education

5)How does marital status affect loan amount?

🛠️ Power BI Features Used
1)Dataflows for reusable ETL logic
2)DAX measures for default rate calculation and YOY metrics
3)Matrix, stacked bar, and donut charts for visual clarity
4)Tooltips and filters for interactive exploration
